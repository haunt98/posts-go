      This is collect of thoughts after I travel around the Internet. Not
      engineering related though.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other
        people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You
        can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it.
        That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it
        marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start
        out life as the wrong idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch
        an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a
        little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too
        much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in
        there too: It may be worth it.

      <p>
        So the principle is straightforward: Set the conditions of “yes” such
        that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If they say “yes,” you’re happy because the terms or money are so
          good, it more than compensates for the distraction, perhaps funding
          the thing you really want to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          If they say “no,” you’re happy because it wasn’t a great fit anyway;
          it’s not a worthwhile return on your time and effort.
        </li>
      </ul>
