# Games 4 fun

Just a little note about apps, games, settings for next time playing :D Please have fun, of course :D

I have tested all software below on:

- My work laptop (Macbook Pro M1 (2020)).

If below links die, I will try to scrape Internet to get a new link.

## PSP emulator

I use [PPSSPP](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp). Currently support macOS.

## PS2 emulator

I use [PCSX2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2). Currently support macOS on nightly builds, but it's good enough.

Should download BIOS, I go with USA version:

- [Another here](https://myrient.erista.me/files/Redump/Sony%20-%20PlayStation%202%20-%20BIOS%20Images/)

For cover art of games, please use [xlenore/ps2-covers](https://github.com/xlenore/ps2-covers).

### [Resident Evil 4](https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Resident_Evil_4)

- [myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/files/Redump/Sony%20-%20PlayStation%202/Resident%20Evil%204%20%28USA%29.zip)

I recommend to use [HD textures](https://gbatemp.net/threads/resident-evil-4-hd-textures-update-2.615869/), it's better
for your eyes:

- Play in 2x/3x **Internal Resolution**
- Disable **Mipmapping**
- Enable **Load Textures**
- Disable **Async Texture Loading**
- Disable **Precache Textures**

![pcsx2-002](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haunt98/posts-images/main/pcsx2-002.jxl)

Please give thanks to [xXtheRockoXx](https://ko-fi.com/xxtherockoxx) for his work.

After download HD textures, please extract then copy to PCSX2 texture folder. Remember to rename it to serial name
(SLUS-21134, ...), because different region has different serial name.

Beautiful result!
