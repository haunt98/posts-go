# Fonts

I always want the best fonts for my terminal, my text editor, my ... But I'm not satisfied easily, so I keep trying new
fonts. Prefer free fonts of course :D

TLDR:

On macOS, prefer [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/). Remember each time macOS release new version/new
update, you should download again to get (maybe) latest version.

Otherwise:

- Use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for display.

Prefer:

- If macOS choose **OTF**, otherwise choose **TTF** format.
- If macOS ignore hinting, otherwise use hinting.
- Choose static font over variable font.

My standard for choosing fonts:

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Has dotted zero, because I dislike slashed zero

Manually install fonts:

- macOS directory: `~/Library/Fonts`
- Linux directory: `~/.local/share/fonts`

## [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)

JetBrains branding font.

Match my standard.

I use:

- `ss02`
- `cv04`
- `cv18`

## [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)

I often choose SS08 variant because I also love PragmataPro too.

Match my standard.

Also:

- Has display font

Font is narrow, can display much more on small screen.

I have custom build [Iosevka Pacman](https://gist.github.com/haunt98/706f379a3a76c80d4b5dfc2e83e7d815) for my own use.

## [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive)

I often choose Casual variant.

Match my standard.

Also:

- Has display font

- [Designing Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/process/)

## [Sudo](https://github.com/jenskutilek/sudo-font)

Small fonts.

Does not match my standard:

- No ligatures

But:

- Has display font

I use:

- `cv06`
- `cv08`

## [M+](https://github.com/coz-m/MPLUS_FONTS)

Does not match my standard:

- No italic
- No ligatures

But:

- Has display font

Love japanese vibe. Also I prefer M PLUS Code Latin 60 because it's wide.

## [Maple Font](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font)

JetBrainsMono look alike.

Match my standard.

Love `@`, `$`. They are sick!

I use:

- `zero`
- `cv03`
- `cv39`

## [agave](https://github.com/blobject/agave)

Small fonts.

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No italic
- No ligatures

I like its curved look.

## [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans)

Comic vibe. Look smoothly and curvely.

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No dotted zero

## [APL-385](https://apl385.com/fonts/index.htm)

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No bold, italic
- No ligatures
- No dotted zero

But:

- Has display font (APL333)
- Has fork with ligatures [APL386](https://github.com/abrudz/APL386)

I love its wide look, also it's feel nostalgic.

## [Hermit](https://github.com/pcaro90/hermit)

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No ligatures
- No dotted zero

Looks unique to me, with some sharp look.

## [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

For fancy terminal, only need `NerdFontsSymbolsOnly`.
