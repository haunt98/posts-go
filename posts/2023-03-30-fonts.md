# Fonts

I always want the best fonts for my terminal, my text editor, my ... But I'm not
satisfied easily, so I keep trying new fonts. Prefer free fonts of course :D

TLDR:

On macOS, use [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for
everything. Remember each time macOS release new version/new update, you should
download again to get (maybe) latest version.

Otherwise:

- Use [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code.
- Use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for display.

Prefer:

- Choose **OTF** over **TTF** format.
- Choose static font over variable font.
- On macOS, ignore hinting. Otherwise, use hinting.

My standard for choosing fonts:

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Has dotted zero, because I dislike slashed zero

## [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)

JetBrains branding font.

Match my standard.

## [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)

I often choose SS08 variant because I also love PragmataPro too.

Match my standard. Also:

- Has display font

Font is narrow, can display much more on small screen.

I have custom build
[Iosevka Pacman](https://gist.github.com/haunt98/706f379a3a76c80d4b5dfc2e83e7d815)
for my own use.

## [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive)

I often choose Casual variant.

Match my standard. Also:

- Has display font

Looks good on my phone.

- [Designing Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/process/)

## [agave](https://github.com/blobject/agave)

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No italic
- No ligatures

Font is small, can display much more on small screen. I like its curved look.

## [Sudo](https://github.com/jenskutilek/sudo-font)

Small fonts, saving space.

Does not match my standard:

- No ligatures

But:

- Has display font

Unique to me. Strange `#`, looks same as `4` (I don't like it).

## [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans)

Comic vibe. Look smoothly and too much curve.

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No dotted zero

## [APL-385](https://apl385.com/fonts/index.htm) and [APL386](https://github.com/abrudz/APL386)

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No bold, italic
- No ligatures (APL-385 not APL386)
- No dotted zero

But:

- Has display font (APL333)

I love its wide look, also it's feel nostalgic.

## [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex)

IBM branding font, good alternative for Inter, has both monospace and display
variant.

Does not match my standard:

- No ligatures

But:

- Has display font

Looks fancy. Strange `#`.

## [Hermit](https://github.com/pcaro90/hermit)

Does not match my standard:

- No Vietnamese
- No ligatures
- No dotted zero

Looks unique to me, with some sharp look.

## [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

For fancy terminal, only need `NerdFontsSymbolsOnly`
