# Swagger or OpenAPI

My company currently use Swagger 2 to document API.

I want to work with OpenAPI 3 but too lazy to convert (for now of course).

So step by step:

- Write API spec in `YAML`.
- Convert to API spec in `JSON`.
- Format spec files.
- Render spec in local.
- Push to company host for other teams to see.

Only step 1 is manual, aka I write my API spec completely with my hand (no auto gen from code whatever). The others can
be done with tools:

```sh
# Convert
go install github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4@latest
yq -o=json '.' ./docs/swagger.yaml > ./docs/swagger.json

# Format
bunx prettier --write ./docs/swagger.yaml ./docs/swagger.json

# Render locally
bunx @redocly/cli preview-docs ./docs/swagger.json
```
