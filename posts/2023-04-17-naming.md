# Naming things

## Filename in storage (S3, ...)

Always have year, month, day in filename to easily sort it out.

If file is uploaded by user, add `user_id` in filename, or some other unique identifier depends on your business in
which you require to upload.

Personally, I always add timestamp and extra data in filename to avoid duplicate.

Example filename: `yyyy/mm/dd/{user_id}-{timestamp}-{extra}.ext`

Be careful with `/`, too much nested folder is no good for backup (as they say, idk if true or not, but less folder mean
less complicated to me).

## Time variable

Add time postfix to make sense.

Instead of `create_at`, use `create_at_ms`.
