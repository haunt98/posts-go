# Unrelated engineer

This is collect of thoughts after I travel around the Internet. Not engineering
related though.

## [Give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes)

> There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other

> Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can
> scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy.
> The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore
> it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong
> idea.

> So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an

> worth it.

## [Never say “no,” but rarely say “yes.”](https://longform.asmartbear.com/say-yes/)

> So the principle is straightforward: Set the conditions of “yes” such that:

  > more than compensates for the distraction, perhaps funding the thing you
  > really want to do.
> - If they say “no,” you’re happy because it wasn’t a great fit anyway; it’s
  > not a worthwhile return on your time and effort.
