# Unrelated engineer

This is collect of thoughts after I travel around the Internet. Not engineering related though.

> There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.

> Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can
> puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it,
> riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.

> So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five
> minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those

## [Never say “no,” but rarely say “yes.”](https://longform.asmartbear.com/say-yes/)

> So the principle is straightforward: Set the conditions of “yes” such that:

> - If they say “yes,” you’re happy because the terms or money are so good, it more than compensates for the
>   distraction, perhaps funding the thing you really want to do.
> - If they say “no,” you’re happy because it wasn’t a great fit anyway; it’s not a worthwhile return on your time and
>   effort.
