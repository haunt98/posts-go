Apps/Services I use daily:

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): password manager
- [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/): 2FA manager
- [Rclone](https://rclone.org/): sync data to cloud

The purpose is that I want my data to be safe, secure, and can be easily recovered if I lost some devices; or in the
worst situation, I lost all. Because you know, it is hard to guess what is waiting for us in the future.

There are 2 main sections which I want to share, the first is **How to backup**, the second is **Recovery strategy**.

## How to backup

Before I talk about backup, I want to talk about data. In specifically, which data should I backup?

I use Arch Linux and macOS, primarily work in the terminal so I have too many dotfiles, for example,
`~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. Each time I reinstall Arch Linux (I like it a lot), I need to reconfigure all the settings,
and it is time-consuming.

So for the DE and UI settings, I keep it as default as possible, unless it's getting in my way, I leave the default
setting there and forget about it. The others are dotfiles, which I write my own
[dotfiles tool](https://github.com/haunt98/dotfiles) to backup and reconfigure easily and quickly. Also, I know that
installing Arch Linux is not easy, despite I install it too many times (like thousand times since I was in high school).
Not because it is hard, but as life goes on, the
[official install guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) keeps getting new update and covering too
many cases for my own personal use, so I write my own
[guide](https://github.com/haunt98/posts-go/blob/main/posts/2022-12-25-archlinux.md) to quickly capture what I need to
do.

So that is my dotfiles, for my regular data, like Wallpaper or Books, Images, I use Google Drive (actually I pay for
it). But the step: open the webpage, click the upload button and choose files seems boring and time-consuming. So I use
Rclone, it supports Google Drive, One Drive and many providers but I only use Google Drive for now. The commands are
simple:

```sh
# Sync from local to remote
# remote can be gdrive, 1drive, ..., anything you previously config with rclone
rclone sync MyBooks remote:MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store

# Sync from remote to local
rclone sync remote:MyBooks MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store
```

The next data is my passwords and my OTPs. These are the things which I'm scare to lose the most. First thing first, I
enable 2-Step Verification for all of my important accounts, should use both OTP and phone method.

I use Bitwarden for passwords (that is a long story, coming from Google Password manager to Firefox Lockwise and then
settle down with Bitwarden) and Aegis for OTPs. The reason I choose Aegis, not Authy (I use Authy for so long but Aegis
is definitely better) is because Aegis allows me to extract all the OTPs to a single file (encrypted or not), which I
use to transfer or backup easily.

As long as Bitwarden provides free passwords stored, I use all of its apps, extensions so that I can easily sync
passwords between laptops and phones. The thing I need to remember is the master password of Bitwarden in my head.

With Bitwardent/Aegis, I also can export the data (must always be encrypted), then:

- Sync to Google Drive
- Store locally in my laptop

## Recovery strategy

There are many strategies that I process to react as if something strange is happening to my devices.

- If I lost my laptops, single laptop or all, do not panic as long as I have my phones. The OTPs are in there, the
  passwords are in Bitwarden cloud, other data is in Google Drive so nothing is lost here.
- If I lost my phone, but not my laptops, I use the OTPs which are stored locally in my laptops.
- In the worst situation, I lost everything, my laptops, my phone. The first step is to recover my SIM, then log in to
  Google account using the password and SMS OTP. After that, log in to Bitwarden account using the master password and
  OTP from Gmail, which I log in previously.
