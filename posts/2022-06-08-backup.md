# Backup my way

First thing first, I want to list my own devices, which I have through the
years:

Apps/Services I use daily:

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): password manager
- [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/): 2FA manager
- [Rclone](https://rclone.org/): sync data to cloud

The purpose is that I want my data to be safe, secure, and can be easily
recovered if I lost some devices; or in the worst situation, I lost all. Because
you know, it is hard to guess what is waiting for us in the future.

There are 2 main sections which I want to share, the first is **How to backup**,
the second is **Recovery strategy**.

## How to backup

Before I talk about backup, I want to talk about data. In specifically, which
data should I backup?

I use Arch Linux and macOS, primarily work in the terminal so I have too many
dotfiles, for example, `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. Each time I reinstall Arch
Linux (I like it a lot), I need to reconfigure all the settings, and it is
time-consuming.

So for the DE and UI settings, I keep it as default as possible, unless it's
getting in my way, I leave the default setting there and forget about it. The
others are dotfiles, which I write my own
[dotfiles tool](https://github.com/haunt98/dotfiles) to backup and reconfigure
easily and quickly. Also, I know that installing Arch Linux is not easy, despite
I install it too many times (like thousand times since I was in high school).
Not because it is hard, but as life goes on, the
[official install guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide)
keeps getting new update and covering too many cases for my own personal use, so
I write my own
[guide](https://github.com/haunt98/posts-go/blob/main/posts/2022-12-25-archlinux.md)
to quickly capture what I need to do.

So that is my dotfiles, for my regular data, like Wallpaper or Books, Images, I
use Google Drive (actually I pay for it). But the step: open the webpage, click
the upload button and choose files seems boring and time-consuming. So I use
Rclone, it supports Google Drive, One Drive and many providers but I only use
Google Drive for now. The commands are simple:

```sh
# Sync from local to remote
# remote can be gdrive, 1drive, ..., anything you previously config with rclone
rclone sync MyBooks remote:MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store

# Sync from remote to local
rclone sync remote:MyBooks MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store
```

The next data is my passwords and my OTPs. These are the things which I'm scare
to lose the most. First thing first, I enable 2-Step Verification for all of my
important accounts, should use both OTP and phone method.

I use Bitwarden for passwords (that is a long story, coming from Google Password
manager to Firefox Lockwise and then settle down with Bitwarden) and Aegis for
OTPs. The reason I choose Aegis, not Authy (I use Authy for so long but Aegis is
definitely better) is because Aegis allows me to extract all the OTPs to a
single file (encrypted or not), which I use to transfer or backup easily.

As long as Bitwarden provides free passwords stored, I use all of its apps,
extensions so that I can easily sync passwords between laptops and phones. The
thing I need to remember is the master password of Bitwarden in my head.

With Bitwardent/Aegis, I also can export the data (must always be encrypted),
then:

- Sync to Google Drive
- Store locally in my laptop
- Don't store locally in phone (can not keep track easily)

## Recovery strategy

There are many strategies that I process to react as if something strange is
happening to my devices.

- If I lost my laptops, single laptop or all, do not panic as long as I have my
  phones. The OTPs are in there, the passwords are in Bitwarden cloud, other
  data is in Google Drive so nothing is lost here.
- If I lost my phone, but not my laptops, I use the OTPs which are stored
  locally in my laptops.
- In the worst situation, I lost everything, my laptops, my phone. The first
  step is to recover my SIM, then log in to Google account using the password
  and SMS OTP. After that, log in to Bitwarden account using the master password
  and OTP from Gmail, which I log in previously.

## The end

This guide will be updated regularly I promise.
