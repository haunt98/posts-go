# Khoan cắt bê tông 101

The title is a joke.

But after digging a few holes on the wall, I think I should leave a few notes
for the future me.

- Be careful to choose countersink drill bit (aka mũi khoan).
  - I pick **wood** type to drill on the wall, and ... it's broken :(
- Always wear gloves to protect your hand before touch the drill bit.
  - It cut my hand :(
